    "- Negative electricity prices exist. This occured a total of 1606 times, with the price being exactly 0€ 65 times. \n",
    "- The lowest recorded price in the data set was -500€, occuring at 2022-08-23 20:00:00. The second lowest price with -399€ was achieved the same day. These are stark outliers, with only 13 entries below the -100€ mark. The sum being exactly 500.00€ in particular stands out as peculiar.\n",
    "- The highest recorded price in the data set was 1047.11€, occurring at  2023-07-02 14:00:00. In total, only 5 entries surpass the 900€ mark, all of them past 2023. "

    "# Explaining negative values\n",
    "Negative wholesale electricity prices are a phenomenon that arises when high and inflexible electricity generation, frequently from renewable sources such as wind and solar, coincides with low demand, particularly during periods of low consumption such as holidays. During these times, producers are remunerated for offloading excess electricity, which results in negative prices. This typically occurs when renewable generation exceeds demand, as evidenced by the case of Easter Monday 2019 in Germany, where the country's entire electricity needs were met by renewable energy production.\n",
