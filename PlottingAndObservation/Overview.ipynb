    "- The lowest recorded price in the data set was -500€, occuring at 2022-08-23 20:00:00. The second lowest price with -399€ was achieved the same day. These are stark outliers, with only 13 entries below the -100€ mark. The sum being exactly 500.00€ in particular stands out as peculiar.\n",

    "# Negative values\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "Negative wholesale electricity prices are a phenomenon that arises when high and inflexible electricity generation, frequently from renewable sources such as wind and solar, coincides with low demand, particularly during periods of low consumption such as holidays. During these times, producers are remunerated for offloading excess electricity, which results in negative prices. This typically occurs when renewable generation exceeds demand, as evidenced by the case of Easter Monday 2019 in Germany, where the country's entire electricity needs were met by renewable energy production.\n",
    "Further information can be found on the smard website itself.\n",
    "https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/5884/105426\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "The lowest recorded price point in the dataset occured on 2023-07-02 12:00, with the oddly specific price of -500€/MWhe. At this point, renewable energy sources introduced 49.7GWh of energy into the system, with a total consumption of only 46.1 GWh. Comperatively, conventional plants produced only 7.1 GWh of electricity at that hour, with 4.1 GWh of electricity being stored by pumped storage power plants\n",
