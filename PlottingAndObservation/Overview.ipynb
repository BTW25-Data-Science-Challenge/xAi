    "# Negative values\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "Negative wholesale electricity prices are a phenomenon that arises when high and inflexible electricity generation, frequently from renewable sources such as wind and solar, coincides with low demand, particularly during periods of low consumption such as holidays. During these times, producers are remunerated for offloading excess electricity, which results in negative prices. This typically occurs when renewable generation exceeds demand, as evidenced by the case of Easter Monday 2019 in Germany, where the country's entire electricity needs were met by renewable energy production.\n",
    "Further information can be found on the smard website itself.\n",
    "https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/5884/105426\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "The lowest recorded price point in the dataset occured on 2023-07-02 12:00, with the oddly specific price of -500€/MWhe. At this point, renewable energy sources introduced 49.7GWh of energy into the system, with a total consumption of only 46.1 GWh. Comperatively, conventional plants produced only 7.1 GWh of electricity at that hour, with 4.1 GWh of electricity being stored by pumped storage power plants\n",

For households and small businesses, the electricity price is capped at 40 cents per kilowatt hour for 80% of the previous year's consumption, while medium-sized and large businesses pay a net price of 13 cents for 70% of their consumption. The measure is financed by the Economic Stabilization Fund. Following a ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court, it was decided that this and similar subsidies would be phased out at the end of 2023, as financing through the reallocation of corona funds was deemed unconstitutional.\n",
